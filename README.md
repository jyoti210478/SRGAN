# Super-Resolution Generative Adversarial Network (SRGAN)
This repository contains the implementation of a Super-Resolution Generative Adversarial Network (SRGAN), a deep learning model designed to enhance the resolution of low-resolution images. The SRGAN model is capable of generating high-quality, high-resolution images from their low-resolution counterparts, making it an ideal tool for applications in image processing, computer vision, and more.

# Model Overview
The SRGAN architecture consists of two primary components:

**Generator:**
The generator is a convolutional neural network (CNN) that takes a low-resolution image as input and outputs a high-resolution image. It uses residual blocks and upsampling layers to reconstruct fine details and textures in the generated image.

**Discriminator:**
The discriminator is another CNN that classifies images as either real (high-resolution) or fake (generated by the generator). It helps the generator improve by providing feedback on how realistic the generated images are.

**VGG Loss Network:**
The model also uses a pre-trained VGG network to compute perceptual loss, which measures the similarity between the generated image and the real high-resolution image in a feature space rather than just pixel-wise.

# Training Process
The SRGAN is trained using a combination of adversarial loss (from the discriminator) and perceptual loss (from the VGG network). The training process involves alternating between training the generator to produce realistic high-resolution images and training the discriminator to accurately distinguish between real and fake images.

# Training Workflow
**Data Preparation:**

The model is trained on paired low-resolution (LR) and high-resolution (HR) images. The LR images are generated by downscaling the HR images.

**Model Training:**
The training process involves multiple epochs, where each epoch consists of several steps:
The generator produces high-resolution images from the LR inputs.
The discriminator is trained on both real HR images and the generated images.
The generator is updated based on the feedback from both the discriminator and the VGG network.

**Using the Pre-Trained Model:**
The repository also provides a method to load a pre-trained generator and use it to enhance the resolution of new low-resolution images. This is particularly useful for real-time applications where quick image enhancement is needed.
